# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to workflowr.
Here are some guidelines to help make it easier to merge your Pull Request:

* For potentially large changes, please open an Issue first to discuss
* Please follow the [Hadley style guide][style]
* Please run the file [scripts/contribute.R](scripts/contribute.R) to check your changes
* (Optional) Run `devtools::test()` to run the tests
* (Optional) Add new test(s) in `tests/testthat/`

If you're new to submitting Pull Requests, please read the section [Contribute
to other projects][contribute] in the tutorial [A quick introduction to version
control with Git and GitHub][git-tutorial].

## Setup a development environment

To contribute to workflowr, follow these steps to setup a development
environment:

1. Fork GitHub repository and clone to your local machine

1. Install dependencies

    ```
    # Install package dependencies
    if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE))
      install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)

    # Install developlment-only dependencies
    install.packages("devtools")

    # Install local copy of workflowr
    devtools::install()
    ```

## More about this repository

For the most part, I try to follow the guidelines from [R packages][r-pkg] by
[Hadley Wickham][hadley]. The unit tests are performed with [testthat][], the
documentation is built with [roxygen2][], and the online package documentation
is created with [pkgdown][].

Minimal continuous integration testing is performed by GitHub Actions for each
push to the repository. Extensive continuous integration testing is performed at
scheduled intervals in [workflowr-pkg-tests][]. Code coverage is calculated with
[covr][] and [Codecov][]. The online package documentation is automatically
generated by running pkgdown from GitHub Actions and pushing to the gh-pages
branch.

The template files used by `wflow_start()` to populate a new project are defined
in the list `templates` in the file `R/infrastructure.R`. The [RStudio project
template][pt] is configured by `inst/rstudio/templates/project/wflow_start.dcf`.
The repository contains the files `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.md` to both adhere to
[R package conventions for defining the license][r-exts-licensing] and also to
make the license clear in a more conventional manner (suggestions for
improvement welcome). The directory `scripts/` contains convenience scripts for
maintaining the R package. The remaining directories are standard for R packages
as described in the manual [Writing R Extensions][r-exts].

## Scripts for maintaining the package

Convenience scripts for maintaining the package are located in `scripts/`. These
are not included in the package tarball for distribution. They are all intended
to be executed from the root directory of the package. The convenience scripts
include:

* `build.sh` runs `R CMD build` and `R CMD check`
* `bump-version.R` bumps the version across all the necessary package files
* `contribute.R` performs some basic checks that should be run before
contributing a Pull Request
* `document.R` regenerates the documentation
* `gather-dependencies.R` extracts the dependencies from `DESCRIPTION` to create
the vector `dependencies` in `R/zzz.R` (which is used to confirm that all the
packages that workflowr needs are properly installed)
* `sed.sh` performs search/replace for all R files in the package

## Release checklist (for maintainers)

* Bump version with [scripts/bump-version.R](scripts/bump-version.R)
* Update [NEWS.md](NEWS.md): Check `git log` and make sure to reference GitHub
Issues/PRs
* Run [scripts/document.R](scripts/document.R) to update Rd files, install the
package locally, and build the online documentation with [pkgdown][]
* Run [scripts/build.sh](scripts/build.sh) to confirm tests pass locally
* Test on [rhub][]:
    * Have to validate email first with `rhub::validate_email()`. Copy-paste
    token from email into R console
    * Check on Ubuntu with `rhub::check_for_cran(platform = "ubuntu-gcc-devel")`
    * Check on Solaris with `rhub::check_for_cran(platform = "solaris-x86-patched")`
* Test on [winbuilder][]:
    * Check with R devel with `devtools::check_win_devel()`
* Update [cran-comments.md](cran-comments.md)
* Commit with `git commit -am "Bump version: x.x.x.x -> x.x.x and re-build
docs."`
* Push with `git push origin main` and wait for CI builds to pass
* Build tarball with `R CMD build .` and upload to [CRAN submission
site][cran-submit]. You will receive an email to request confirmation, then an
email confirming the package was submitted, and then an email with the test
results. Once it is accepted to CRAN, monitor the [check results][check-results]
for any surprise errors. Also, these builds are when the binaries are built for
Windows and macOS, so they aren't available until they are finished. You will
receive an email once all the Windows binaries are available for download
(devel, release, oldrel).
* You can monitor the status of the CRAN submission with the [foghorn][]
package:

    ```
    foghorn::cran_incoming("workflowr")
    foghorn::cran_details("workflowr")
    foghorn::cran_results(pkg = "workflowr")
    ```
* Tag with `git tag -a vx.x.x`. Summarize [NEWS.md](NEWS.md) entry into bullet
points. Run ` git tag -l -n9` for past examples. Push with `git push origin
--tags`.
* Make a release. On GitHub, go to Releases -> Tags -> Edit release notes. Name
the release "workflowr x.x.x" and copy-paste the Markdown entry from
[NEWS.md](NEWS.md).
