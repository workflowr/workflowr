# workflowr 0.7.0.9000

* Minor changes to improve error messages and documentation.

* Added tag to footer.html to adjust MathJax settings so that all math
formulae are shown using TeX fonts only. This will make the
presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load.

* Added new function `wflow_push()` that performs the equivalent of `git push`
directly from the R console.

# workflowr 0.7.0

## wflow_build

* `wflow_build()` automatically opens the website after building files, thus
it's not necessary to always run `wflow_view()` manually afterwards. If one file
is built, then that file is opened. If more than one file is built, then the
index page is opened. (#41)
* `wflow_build()` adds objects to the global environment when building files
locally in the R console (i.e. `local = TRUE`) (#53)

## Miscellaneous

* Bug fix so workflowr can process Emacs backup files that contain a tilde (#47)
* Bug fix so print methods display properly in the R console (some did not end
with a newline character)

# workflowr 0.6.0

## New function wflow_remove

* `wflow_remove()` removes R Markdown files and all their associated files (e.g.
HTML and figures)
* If the files to be removed had been committed to the Git repository, the files
are also removed from the Git repository (analogous to `git rm`)
* `wflow_remove()` also works on non-Rmd files

## Improved support for Windows

* workflowr functions can now handle backslashes in filepaths
* `wflow_update()` and `wflow_convert()` fail gracefully if the `diff` utility is not available and inform the user to install [Rtools][]

## Miscellaneous

* Added continuous integration testing with [Travis CI][travis] for macOS
* Updated documentation in README, "Getting started" vignette, and FAQ

# workflowr 0.5.1

This minor release fixes a bug in how filepaths are resolved so that workflowr
can run on Windows.

# workflowr 0.5.0

This release changes the interface of some of the main workflowr functions. The 
functions `wflow_publish()` and `wflow_status()` are introduced, and the 
previous functions `wflow_build()` and `wflow_commit()` are re-designed.

## wflow_status

* New function `wflow_status()` reports which analysis files require user
attention (inspired by `git status`)

* Defines R Markdown files whose HTML has been committed as part of the Git repo
as "Published", R Markdown files which have been committed to the Git repo but 
not their HTML as "Unpublished", and R Markdown files that are untracked by Git 
as "Scratch". Furthermore, previously published files that have been 
subsequently edited are classified as "Modified". See the man page
`?wflow_status` for more details.

## wflow_publish

* This new function replaces the previous functionality of `wflow_commit()`. The
basic interface is much simpler.

* `wflow_publish("analysis/file.Rmd")` will 1) commit `analysis/file.Rmd`, 2) 
build `analysis/file.Rmd` in its own separate R session with `set.seed(12345)`, 
and 3) commit `docs/file.html` and any generated figures. These 3 steps are
referred to as "publishing a file".

* `wflow_publish(all = TRUE)` will publish all tracked analysis files, analogous
to `git commit -a`.

* To change the theme or make some other change to the entire site, run 
`wflow_publish("analysis/_site.yml", republish = TRUE)`, which will 1) commit 
the configuration file `analysis/_site.yml`, 2) re-build all the previously 
published analysis files using the new configuration options, and 3) commit the 
re-built HTML files.

## wflow_build

* By default, `wflow_build()` runs in "Make"-mode, only building R Markdown 
files that have been updated more recently than their corresponding HTML files. 
If instead files are specfically stated, those files will be built.

* By default, R Markdown files are now built each in their own separate R 
session (similar in function to the "Knit HTML" button in RStudio). This
prevents undesirable behavior like sharing variables and loaded packages across
separate files. Set `local = TRUE` to build the files in the local R console
(useful for debugging, but otherwise discouraged).

* By default, the seed for random number generation is set to the arbitrary 
number `12345` (using `set.seed()`). This ensures that any code that produces 
random numbers will be reproducible.

## wflow_commit

* `wflow_commit()` has been demoted to only being a wrapper for the equivalent 
functionality of `git add` and `git commit`. This can be useful for committing 
non-analysis files or R Markdown files that you aren't ready to publish yet. 
However, you should use `wflow_publish()` for the standard workflow.

* Set `all = TRUE` to run the equivalent of `git commit -a`.

## wflow_update

* Improved documentation of `wflow_update()` to better explain its 
functionality. It will attempt to convert all R Markdown files present to use 
the latest version of the workflowr R Markdown template; however, it will only 
commit R Markdown files that are tracked by Git.

## Miscellaneous

* All workflowr functions should now accept the file extesion `.rmd` in addition
to `.Rmd` (Issue #10)

* Replaced the shared argument `path` with `project` to clarify that this
argument specifies the path to a directory in the workflowr project

* `wflow_start()` now includes `docs/.nojekyll`

* Change dependency to R >= 3.2.5 (Issue #32)

* Change stringr dependency (>= 1.1.0)

* Started a vignette with Frequently Asked Questions

* Added sections to README (Quick start, Upgrading, Related work, and Citation)

# workflowr 0.4.0

## wflow_start

* The `wflow_start()` API has been simplified. Now the first (and only required) argument is the directory to be created. By default, the name of the project will be determined from the directory name. For example, `wflow_start("~/projects/proj-x")` will create a workflowr project with the name "proj-x". To specify a different name, provide the argument `name`
* New argument `change_wd = TRUE` changes the working directory to the newly created project. 
* New argument `existing = FALSE` is a safety feature so that by default workflowr projects are only created in new directories
* `wflow_start()` no longer adds "BuildType: Website" to RStudio project file.
Users should run `wflow_build()` instead. `wflow_update()` removes the build specification for existing workflowr projects
* Fixed bugs related to relative paths and nested paths

## workflowr R Markdown template

* Updated workflowr R Markdown template can be built even if the user does not have workflowr installed
* Use new function `wflow_convert()` to convert an R Markdown file based on the previous template to use the latest version
* New optional "standalone" version of the workflowr template for creating files outside of a workflowr project (set `standalone = TRUE` for `wflow_open()`)
* Can create a workflowr R Markdown file outside of a workflowr project by setting `path = NULL`

## Migrating an existing project to use workflowr

* New vignette on "Migrating an existing project to use workflowr"
* `wflow_update()` function updates workflowr projects to use the latest version of the template
* `wflow_convert()` converts an existing R Markdown file to use the workflowr template (can also update a file that uses a previous version of the template)

## Other new functions

* `wflow_view()` opens the website in the browser
* `wflow_remotes()` manages remote Git repositories on GitHub. It can add a remote, remove a remote, or update the URL for an existing remote

## Improvements to the workflowr R package itself

* Continuous integration testing with [Travis CI][travis]
* Code coverage with [covr][] and [Codecov][]
* Package documentation with [pkgdown][]

# workflowr 0.3.0

* Second alpha release. Major API overhaul.

* Improved naming of functions: `start_project` -> `wflow_start`, `open_rmd` -> `wflow_open`, `build_site` -> `wflow_build`, `commit_site` -> `wflow_commit`, `create_results` -> `create_links_page`

* `wflow_commit` can optionally add and commit provided files (argument is `commit_files`) before re-building website and commiting HTML files

* `wflow_open` accepts multiple filenames

* Both `wflow_build` and `wflow_commit` have the argument `all` to optionally build all the HTML files

# workflowr 0.2.0

* First alpha release. Contains enough functions to create workflowr project from scratch.

* Main functions: `start_project`, `open_rmd`, `build_site`, `commit_site`, `create_results`

# workflowr 0.1.0

* Initial demonstration of idea.
