The workflowr R package helps researchers organize their analyses in a way that
promotes effective project management, reproducibility, collaboration, and
sharing of results. Workflowr combines literate programming (knitr and
rmarkdown) and version control (Git, via git2r) to generate a website containing
time-stamped, versioned, and documented results. Any R user can quickly and
easily adopt workflowr.

For more details, see the [online documentation][workflowr-docs]. For an
example, see the [Divvy data exploration project][divvy]. To explore
reproducible research projects facilitated by workflowr, browse the projects
registered at [workflowr.io][]. To keep up-to-date with the latest workflowr
developments, please join the [workflowr-announce][] mailing list (low-volume,
read-only). For bugs reports, feature requests, and questions, please open an
[Issue][issues].

## Features

* Organized
    * Provides a project template with organized subdirectories
    * Mixes code and results with R Markdown
    * Uses Git to version both source code and results
* Reproducible
    * Displays the code version used to create each result
    * Runs each analysis in an isolated R session
    * Records the session information of each analysis
    * Sets the same seed for random number generation for each analysis
* Shareable
    * Creates a website to present your research results
    * Documents how to host your website for free via [GitHub Pages][] or
    [GitLab Pages][]
    * Creates links to past versions of results

To see a workflowr website in action, see this [video demonstration][video].

For related tools, see [r-project-workflows][].

## Installation

1. Install [R][r]

    * (Recommended) Install [RStudio][rstudio]

    * (Optional) Install [pandoc][] ([Instructions][pandoc-install])

    * (Optional) Install [Git][git]

1. Install workflowr from [CRAN][cran]:

    ```r
    install.packages("workflowr")
    ```

1. Create an account on [GitHub][gh] or [GitLab][gl]

## Quick start

```
library("workflowr")

# Configure Git (only need to do once per computer)
wflow_git_config(user.name = "Full Name", user.email = "email@domain")

# Start a new workflowr project
wflow_start("myproject")

# Build the site
wflow_build()

# Customize your site!
#   1. Edit the R Markdown files in analysis/
#   2. Edit the theme and layout in analysis/_site.yml
#   3. Add new or copy existing R Markdown files to analysis/

# Preview your changes
wflow_build()

# Publish the site, i.e. version the source code and HTML results
wflow_publish("analysis/*", "Start my new project")
```

**Next steps:**

1. Read the full [Getting started vignette][vig-start] to learn how to share
your results online. Alternatively, you could read the [Reproducible research
workshop vignette][vig-workshop]. It covers the same steps, but includes example
code and data to demonstrate some of workflowr's reproducibility features

1. Read the [customization vignette][vig-custom] for ideas on how to customize
your research website

1. Read the [migrating vignette][vig-migrating] for how to integrate workflowr
into your existing project

## Attribution

Workflowr was developed, and is maintained, by John Blischak, a postdoctoral
researcher in the laboratory of [Matthew Stephens][stephens] at [The University
of Chicago][uchicago]. He is funded by a grant from the [Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation][moore] to MS. [Peter Carbonetto][pcarbo] and [Matthew
Stephens][stephens] are co-authors.

We are very thankful to workflowr [contributors][] for helping improve the
package. We are also grateful for workflowr users for testing the package and
providing feedback---thanks especially to [Lei Sun][lsun], [Xiang
Zhu][xiangzhu], [Wei Wang][nkweiwang], and other members (past and present) of
the Stephens lab.

The workflowr package uses many great open source packages. Especially critical
for this project are the R packages [git2r][], [knitr][], and [rmarkdown][].
Please see the vignette [How the workflowr package works][vig-details] to learn
about the software that makes workflowr possible.
