\title{Report status of workflowr project}
\usage{
wflow_status(files = NULL, include_git_status = TRUE, project = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{character (default: NULL) The analysis file(s) to report the
status. By default checks the status of all analysis files. Supports
file \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)}{globbing}.}

\item{include_git_status}{logical (default: TRUE) Include the Git status of
the project files in the output. Note that this excludes any files in the
website directory, since these generated files should only be committed by
workflowr, and not the user.}

\item{project}{character (default: ".") By default the function assumes the
current working directory is within the project. If this is not true,
you'll need to provide the path to the project directory.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{wflow_status}, which is a list with
  the following elements:

\itemize{

\item \bold{root}: The relative path to the root directory of the workflowr
project (i.e. contains the RStudio .Rproj file).

\item \bold{analysis}: The relative path to the directory that contains
\code{_site.yml} and the R Markdown files.

\item \bold{docs}: The relative path to the directory that contains the HTML
files and figures.

\item \bold{git}: The relative path to the \code{.git} directory that
contains the history of the Git repository.

\item \bold{site_yml}: \code{TRUE} if the configuration file \code{_site.yml}
has uncommitted changes, otherwise \code{FALSE}.

\item \bold{wflow_yml}: \code{TRUE} if the configuration file
\code{_workflowr.yml} has uncommitted changes, otherwise \code{FALSE}. If the
file does not exist, the result is \code{NULL}. If the file was recently
deleted and not yet committed to Git, then it will be \code{TRUE}.

\item \bold{git_status} The Git status as a \code{git_status}
object from the package \link[git2r]{git2r} (see \code{git2r::\link[git2r]{status}}).

\item \bold{include_git_status} The argument \code{include_git_status}
indicating whether the Git status should be printed along with the status of
the Rmd files.

\item \bold{status}: A data frame with detailed information on the status of
each R Markdown file (see below).

}

The data frame \code{status} contains the following non-mutually exclusive
columns (all logical vectors):

\itemize{

\item \bold{ignored}: The R Markdown file has been ignored by Git according
to the patterns in the file \code{.gitignore}.

\item \bold{mod_unstaged}: The R Markdown file has unstaged modifications.

\item \bold{conflicted}: The R Markdown file has merge conflicts.

\item \bold{mod_staged}: The R Markdown file has staged modifications.

\item \bold{tracked}: The R Markdown file is tracked by Git.

\item \bold{committed}: The R Markdown file has been previously committed to
the Git repository.

\item \bold{published}: The corresponding HTML file has been previously
committed.

\item \bold{mod_committed}: The R Markdown file has modifications that have
been committed since the last time the HTML was built and committed.

\item \bold{modified}: The R Markdown file has been modified since it was
last published (i.e. \code{mod_unstaged} or \code{mod_staged} or
\code{mod_committed}).

\item \bold{unpublished}: The R Markdown file is tracked by Git but not
published (i.e. the HTML has not been committed).

\item \bold{scratch}: The R Markdown file is untracked by Git, i.e. it is
considered a scratch file until it is committed.

\description{
\code{wflow_status} reports the analysis files that require user action.
}
\details{
\code{wflow_status} reports analysis files with one of the following
statuses:

\itemize{

\item \bold{Mod}: Modified file. Any published file that has been modified
since the last time the HTML was published.

\item \bold{Unp}: Unpublished file. Any tracked file whose corresponding HTML
is not tracked. May or may not have staged or unstaged changes.

\item \bold{Scr}: Scratch file. Any untracked file that is not specifically
ignored.

}

\code{wflow_status} only works for workflowr projects that use Git.
