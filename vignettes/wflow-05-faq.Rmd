## Can I make my workflowr website private?

Short answer: Not if you host it on GitHub Pages. For an alternative, see "Can I share workflowr websites directly with collaborators in a secure fashion?" below.

Long answer: Even if you create a private GitHub repository, the website it
creates is still public. If you're not ready to publish your results online, you
can always wait and activate GitHub Pages later. In the meantime, you'll still
have a version-controlled, organized set of results for your project. However,
the risk that someone that doesn't have the link to your website is able to find
it is very low. Search engines prioritize the results by how many other sites
link to a site, so your website will not be high in the results even if you
search for very specific terms. Thus if you only share the URL to your results
with your close collaborators, and request that they not share it widely, your
website is effectively private. That being said, being truly scooped in science
is rare (at best) and openly sharing your work will help establish your
expertise in the field (and furthermore establishes your priority), so you
should consider keeping both your code and website public.

## Can I include Shiny apps in my website?

No, at least not in the standard setup. The website is hosted with GitHub pages,
which only supports static web pages. Shiny apps are dynamic, i.e. a user can
interact with them to change the content. The easiest way to share your Shiny
app would be to host it at [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/) and add a
link to your app on your workflowr website. Alternatively you could host your
workflowr website on your own server, but that would require much more knowledge
and resources to accomplish.

## Can I change "X" on my website?

Almost certainly yes, but some things are easier to customize than others. The
vignette [Customize your research website](wflow-02-customization.html) provides
some ideas that are simple to implement. Check out the documentation for
[rmarkdown][] and [Twitter Bootstrap][Bootstrap] for inspiration.

## Why am I not getting the same result with `wflow_build()` as with the RStudio Knit HTML button?

`wflow_build()` is designed to have the same functionality as the Knit HTML
button in RStudio, namely that it knits the HTML file in a separate R session to
avoid any clashes with variables or pacakges in use in the current R session.
However, the technical implementations are not identical, and thus informally we
have noticed the behavior of the two options occassionally differs. At the
moment, we believe that if the file results in an error when using
`wflow_build()`, the file needs to be fixed, regardless of whether the file is
able to be built with the RStudio button. If you have a use case that you think
should be supported by `wflow_build()`, please open an [Issue][issues] and
provide a small reproducible example.

## Can I share workflowr websites directly with collaborators in a secure fashion?

Yes! After some background framing the problem, see ACTIONS below for a method using [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) developed in response to [Issue 59](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr/issues/59):

### Sharing **entire** workflowr sites

Hosting scientific data externally (e.g., on cloud hosts, including GitHub), can be fraught with problems. Academic institutions frown on the practice (for example, for intellectual property reasons), and internal solutions can start and stop with shared drives and Dropbox/Dropbox-like alternatives.

Workflowr is truly revelatory for generating *organized* .html output for Rmarkdown projects. However, the easiest way to share individual compiled .Rmd documents with collaborators was still by using *render* in the console *a la*

    render("analysis/file.Rmd", pdf_document()).
for .PDF output, or,

    render("analysis/file.Rmd", word_document()).
for Word output (per @jdblischak). However, sharing the entire Workflowr-generated site, including what can be invaluable information in associated Index.Rmd and License.Rmd files is highly desirable.

### Direct sharing of entire workflowr-generated Sites using Beaker Browser

[Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) allows website creation, cloning, modification, and publishing locally. After the site is ready, hitting "share" produces a unique [Dat project dat://](https://datproject.org/) hyperlink, for example:

    dat://adef21aa8bbac5e93b0c20a97c6f57f93150cf4e7f5eb1eb522eb88e682309bc

This dat:// link can then be shared and the site opened *all the while being hosted locally on the site producer's machine.* The particular example above is a site, produced in Rstudio using Workflowr, with placeholder content and R code chunks, compiled as usual.

Security for your site is achieved with site encryption inherent in the Dat protocol (see "Security" on the [datproject docs page](https://docs.datproject.org/)), as well as the obscurity of the unique link.

Beaker Browser saves your individual project sites in a folder, /Sites, that is found in the home directory by default.

### ACTIONS 

To create a Beaker Browser version of your Workflowr site:

1. Select "New Site" in the three-bar dropdown menu found to the right of the "omnibar" for web link entry, and enter its Title and (optional) a Description of the site. This creates a folder in the Beaker Browser /Sites directory named for your Title, for example, "placeholder_workflowr", and populates the folder with a dat.json file.

    ~/Users/joshua/Sites/placeholder_workflowr

1. In the main Beaker Browser pane, use "Add Files" or "Open Folder" to copy the entire contents of the Workflowr /docs folder (the location of the project's compiled .html output) to your new Beaker Browser site folder (see Symlink Synchronization, below).
1. Once copied, the new site is ready to go. Pressing "Share" in the main Beaker Browser pane reveals the unique dat:// link generated for your Beaker Browser site. Sharing this link with anyone running Beaker Browser will allow them to access your Workflowr .html content...*directly from your computer*.

### Symlink Synchronization Between Workflowr /analysis and Beaker Browser Site

Per @jdblischak: To keep your Beaker Browser site up to date with freshly compiled Workflowr content, [you can] create a symlink from your workflowr docs/ directory to the Beaker Browser site directory. The line below links the docs/ directory of a hypothetical "workflowr-project" saved in ~/github/ to the hypothetical Beaker placeholder_workflowr Sites subdirectory:

    ln -s ~/github/workflowr-project/docs ~/Users/joshua/Sites/placeholder_workflowr

### Hosting Beaker Browser Sites

The direct-sharing nature of the above workflow means that the host computer needs to be running for site access. Beaker Browser developer @pfrazee pointed to [hashbase.io](https://hashbase.io) and the Beaker Browser subproject [dathttpd](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/dathttpd). While hosting Beaker Browser sites is outside of the scope of this direct sharing paradigm, each of these options has strengths. The former, hashbase.io (free account required), is a web-hosted central location for dat:// -linked content, removing the need for the host computer to be running. The latter dathttpd example is an additional server/self-hosting option that can be used if desired.
