## Introduction

The [Getting Started vignette][vig-getting-started] provides instructions for
deploying the workflowr website using the service [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]
because it is quick and convenient. However, the static website created by
workflowr can be deployed using any strategy you like. Below are instructions
for deploying the workflowr website contributed by other workflowr users. If you
would like to contribute instructions for another deployment strategy, please
fork the [workflowr repository][workflowr] on GitHub and add your instructions
to this file. If you need any assistance with this, please
don't hesitate to open an [Issue][wflow-issues].

## Amazon S3 (password-protected)

Another way to privately share your workflowr site is by uploading it to [Amazon
S3][s3]. S3 is an object storage service for the Amazon cloud, and can be used
to host static websites. Basic HTTP authentication can be accomplished using
[CloudFront][cloudfront], Amazon's content delivery network, and
[Lamba@Edge][lambda], which enables the execution of serverless functions to
customize content delivered by the CDN. This [blog post][hackernoon] goes into
more detail about what that all means. Some templates for scripting the process are
[here][dumrauf].

## GitLab Pages

To deploy your workflowr website with [GitLab Pages][gitlab], you can use the
function `wflow_use_gitlab()`. You can choose if the site is public or private.
For more details, please see the dedicated vignette [Hosting workflowr websites
using GitLab](wflow-06-gitlab.html).
